      <p>Benevolent Tech invents digital & physical experiences. Our marketers, designers and makers build everything from marketing strategy, to SEO, to websites, to apps, to wildly creative ad campaigns that reach audiences globally.</p>

      <p>Formally Benevolent Web, Benevolent Tech was founded in May 2012 by Brian Dombrowski in Washington, DC. Since its inception, Benevolent Tech has differentiated itself by focusing on the needs of small business and nonprofits.</p>

      <p>We do a lot. Weâ€™re alternately called a marketing agency, web agency, a software company, a user-experience design firm, a digital transformation agency, a technology consultant, or simply (and hopefully), your partner.</p>
