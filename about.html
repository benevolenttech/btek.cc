      <p><span style="font-size: 1.38rem;">I started Benevolent Tech because I love working with and helping small businesses, especially those who foster community. Coming from a technical background, I've found my interests and skills best align with helping small businesses with their online communications.</span></p>
      <p>Towards that end, I've dedicated the past 6 years of my professional career to learning as much as I can about online marketing and website technologies which are beautiful inside and out, affordable, easy to use,&nbsp;<em>and</em> boost sales. Think of us as Red Bull for your business.</p>
      <p><strong>Here's our 3 step process:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Building you a beautiful, sales-optimized website to guide customers happily down a path to purchasing your product, while at the same time reflecting your brand vision.</li>
        <li>Getting your business more attention with custom-tailored search engine optimization, advertising and social media branding.</li>
        <li>Continuous improvements based on real-world analytics.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Customers are searching the internet right now for your product and choose competitors because they don't know you exist. <a href="/contact">Team up now</a> and get found. Not quite ready?
