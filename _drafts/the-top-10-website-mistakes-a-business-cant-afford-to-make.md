No matter what industry your business is in and regardless of the size of your business, a website can be extremely beneficial to bringing in more customers and informing people about your brand. The problem that many business owners fall into however is that they can make mistakes over the process of creating their website as well as with managing their website. Here are some of the 10 most common mistakes that businesses make when they start to create a website and how these mistakes can be avoided:

**Not creating a blog:**blogs are beneficial for a website. They can continually drive traffic to a website, they can inform users about everything that has to do with your business, they can provide new updates on your business as well as establish authority in your niche. In order for your website to rank well on search engine results, you need to continuously produce content that is of great benefit to the people in your readership. If you are going to be starting a website you also need to successfully create a blog in order to build a consistent following for your business.

**Clutter:** too much clutter on a webpage is otherwise called the NASCAR effect and this is where a webpage starts to resemble the side of a stock car. With too much clutter on your webpage it's far too difficult for users to actually see the elements of your page that should be commanding their attention. Too much clutter can also make navigation difficult ensuring that the goals of your page will likely not be met because your users are confused from the moment that they access your business website.

**Text that isnâ€™t easy to read:** your users are going to one extremely digestible text on your webpage. This means that all of your content should have appropriate subheadings, bulleted lists, images, highlighted keywords, shorter paragraphs, and easy writing style and more. If a user can simply scan through your website and the content that's on it, it's possible that they could leave your webpage for a long period of time.

**Offering zero information for your customers:** a business website usually has the goal of answering the questions of your customers. If you don't have an active FAQ or even a customer service department it's possible that your users may not ever buy your product. Most users are interested in finding the information that they are looking for quickly rather than having to use a search bar to look up products on your page. If there is a product line that is particularly popular for your business, consider putting a featured section with the most common answers for that product front and center. Knowing the most relevant questions that your customers might have an immediately answering them will ensure that your page has instant value.

**Having a design that is inconsistent:**Older style web designs as well as a user interface that simply isn't usable is going to be a huge detriment for your webpage. A simple user interface is exactly what someone's looking for when they access a business website. Keep the interface very clean and simple to use. When it comes down to a website for a business, users are likely going to want to spend most of their time on other websites online. Making the information that they want to find very accessible and creating a design that is professional and consistent with your branding is very important.

**Zero focus on your customers:**a page that is entirely focused on your brand or on making a sale is likely going to have a much lower conversion rate than a business page that also takes your customers into account. When you follow a link to a sales page, you'll likely expect to see an add to cart button as well as plenty of information on the product. Having a page that also introduces you, the benefits that your product can have the consumers as well as how they can reach out to you over social media, customer service and more creates a more customer service approach. Even though many users prefer to have online experiences for purchasing items, they still want to have a traditional sales experience where they are focused in on and engaged for their sale.

**Nothing is interactive:** If your website is an absolute boring scrollfest for users, they likely won't come back. Keeping the patience of your users is extremely important in this means having content items like videos, moving logos, interactive product demos and even featured content on your products on the main page. If all of your content looks very generic and your page is just text to scroll through, this can be a huge problem for engagement and interaction.

**Old and tired content:** If you have older content on your page that is out of date and perhaps not even relevant to your product anymore, it is important to prune it away. Regularly changing the featured content on your page as well as establishing rules for eliminating posts when they become ineffective, can help to make sure all of the content on your page has real value.

**Poor search functions:**search functions on a webpage are definitely needed in order to find certain items especially when your navigation function fails or when components of your website may fail. If a person is looking for an item that is not commonly referenced on your page it is also important to consider including a search function that will handle the most important queries for specific items. If your search function doesn't work well, there could be completely inaccessible items on your webpage. Search needs to be integrated into your website design and it's normally just a small and simple box in the top bar or integrated into one of the sidebars so that your users can search for product names or a section of the site. There are many businesses that forget to even include this search function however.

**Too many focused advertisements:** if your webpage just looks like a giant advertisement it is going to have a massive bounce rate. Many businesses ignore looking into legitimate design and consider using their page specifically for advertising their products as well as gaining ad revenue. Never have a banner advertisement that takes the most focus on your page, consider eliminating any distracting animations as these can detract from the goal of your page and never include pop-up windows on your page unless you absolutely have to.
