Any top nonprofit today needs to have a successful website in order to garner new donations and to see continued success in their market. Whether a nonprofit is working towards an education fund, bringing clean water or helping out homeless in a small community the conditions of their content and their website needs to be properly focused. Ultimately the content and the website that a non profit uses will be the main argument or advertising method that they will use to educate and inform their donors. There are however many nonprofits that fall short and make mistakes with both their website content as well as their website design. Here are some of the top 10 mistakes that many nonprofits make with their content as well as their website:

**Confusing/crowded layout:** The most popular style of layout today for any website is the idea of having a very clean and simple design. This type of simple design will draw the eye towards content that the website creator wants its users to see. When a website visitor is bombarded by a number of different images, buttons, logos, moving widgets and advertisements as soon as they access the homepage this can create a massive amount of confusion as to where they should proceed next. Any website design needs to have a clear goal in mind for the user as soon as they access the page. If a nonprofit is unable to convey this goal in their website design, this can make it difficult for them to share their message. Tracking analytics to see where individuals go on their page as soon as they view it can be a helpful step in the right direction to changing the design.

**A nonprofit without a blog:** nonprofits will need blogs in order to provide regular updates to their users. Blogs are essential to websites in almost any industry because they can help to rank the webpage on search engines, it can convert your traffic into regular leads for the website as well as continually drive new traffic into the website by constantly ranking new links. Blogs are especially important to nonprofits as they provide regular updates to users who are donating to that particular cause. If a nonprofit isn't showing the work that they are doing and helping donors feel connected, this can potentially be the cause of lost donations and support. Even something as simple as creating an external word press blog or tumblr is a great way to keep your nonprofit much more connected to your users and to ensure that there is a constant stream of traffic making its way to the blog.

**Poor quality text layout:**The people that access a nonprofit also want to have text that is laid out in a nice format. Reading over a giant wall of text that isn't broken down into paragraphs or subheads, bullet lists, bolded keywords, a simple writing style and more can be very intimidating to access. Breaking up the content with images can be another strategy that can also create blogs which are more entertaining. Poor quality text layout can often be the cause of a bounce rate with a nonprofit blog or website content.

**Too much pressure for donations:** While the end goal of any nonprofit is likely going to be to work towards getting quality donations for the organization, constantly bombarding users with a call to action to donate can be detrimental to the cause. A nonprofit needs to make sure that a user is well-informed and engaged before they go about the process of asking for donations. A website asking for a donation or a sale needs to continue the same traditional sales model of engaging the customer, focusing on their needs and addressing how they can help with their donation or their sale or how they can be benefitted themselves. Making sure that there is at least some lead up to a call to action is very important as the donation rates will increase when users aren't constantly pressured to just donate without being informed.

**A donation button that's very hidden:** A donation button needs to be easy to access and if you need people to donate to your website it's very important that the donation button is quite easy to find. If a person is hunting around for the donation button over an extensive amount of time they could just give up. Your nonprofit needs to make a donation button quite visible and you could even consider putting it at the end of important posts. Make sure that the donation buttons placed up on your site are visible and extremely simple so that there is no question what they are for.

**Scrolling without engagement:** A giant text website is going to be problematic from the perspective of every non-profit. Although a nonprofit may not have access to a gigantic budget for their webdesign, including just a few small elements such as an animated logo or even a short video posted the end of a featured blog can work at breaking up some of the scrolling. If there are content items or pages which have a fair length, adding in a bit of visual content to break it up is important.

**A design that fits current standards:**Many nonprofits are still using older style design standards which are consistent with their current branding. If you are going to update your logo or even your print materials, your website has to be updated first. Consistency with your branding and with the current image of your nonprofit is extremely important. If you are changing focuses or you are trying to appeal to a new audience you need to work at updating your website so that the design fits your current objectives and current design standards. Creating a website that meets the expectations of your users is going to be very important in this can sometimes mean checking into other websites within your niche as well as the types of designs that your target market might regularly access. Consider what you might expect accessing your webpage as a user and work at creating a page experience that has clearly defined goals and a modern style design.

**Dated content:** many nonprofits simply publish content and let it sit on their website for years. Older content may actually be detracting from the goals of your website and impacting your search engine ranking as well. Over the course of every year you should look back on your content, check the analytics and its effectiveness and consider cleaning up the content that you published, discarding it or archiving it to return to later. This will ensure that the content is up on your website meets the goals of your organization currently.

**A nonexistent search function:**In some cases a person may visit your nonprofit website with the express idea of seeking out a member of your staff, an event that your nonprofit appeared at or some other type of information directly regarding your non-profit organization. Without having a proper search bar and a proper search function on your webpage, you could be making the process of finding this information next to impossible for your users. Without a clearly defined search function, you could be missing one of the most important aspects of your webpage.

**Making the page look like an advertisement:**Bombarding your potential customers with a page that looks like a giant advertisement can be difficult as it is, the problem that many nonprofits fall into is creating a design that looks like a gigantic advertising page. Be sure to consider the size of your banner ads, the types of animations and videos that you set to autoplay as well as any pop up ads that could be on your page. Each of these elements are some of the most hated webpage elements that many website visitors don't want to see when they visit the page of a non-profit. Cleaning up your page and turning the focus back to your message rather than making it a giant advertisement can help to improve your content/ engagement.&nbsp;
