Fortune 500 companies as well as some the world's largest websites need to continuously produce high-impact content which is interesting and valuable. **Creating a blog can do wonders for your website** and having ongoing traffic for your website will ensure the longevity of your site as well as a greater chance that you can accomplish the goals you set out for that site.

Content strategy should be one of the most talked about suggestions for the future of your page. Without ongoing content is very difficult for your page to continue staying relevant and you will likely have to spend a lot more money in the process of promoting your page as well. **Valuable content will continuously bring people back to your page** and keep them on page and if you are somehow able to replicate that success with ongoing instances of viral or valuable content, you can truly create a very special website.

**So why should you create a blog for your website with ongoing content?**

**It can help you drive consistent traffic to your website:**every time that you post something new into the blog this gives a chance for new visitors to come and discover your website. Driving new traffic to your website can help you to consistently grow and regardless of what type of site you are running, continuous growth is the only way that you can ensure success for your page.

**Converting new traffic into leads:** once you start to bring people to your website this can help you convert them into new sales, regular visitors, subscribers and even ad revenue providers. If someone is consistently visiting your website or even viewing ads on your website, this can support the future longevity of that site. Converting traffic into someone that sticks around for just a few minutes could be all you need to do multiple times to make sure that your website starts to make money.

**It helps with authority back links:** Creating new links for your website and gaining authority in your niche can be difficult if you are consistently producing content. By making sure that you have new content that contains keywords in your niche as well as information about your brand, you will make sure that you can start to beat out the competition on search engine rankings.

It can be very difficult to actually obtain a top search engine spot or any type of success with search engine optimization without the use of a blog. For many types of businesses such as nonprofits it's almost impossible to even consider starting a website without ongoing content or a high impact blog that continuously brings in new visitors. A great example of how you can leverage a blog from the perspective of a non-profit is by showing off some of the current initiatives that you're working on, the successes you are having, profiles on staff members, chores of your organization as well as helpful ways that your website is making an impact in local communities.

You don't necessarily have to include the blog directly on your main page or pay for hosting on blog content either. Even some of the top companies in the world start their blogs on a WordPress site or tumbler in order to link back to pages on their website especially to save on the cost of hosting early on. Creating a blog and hosting it with your own website however does often lead to greater levels of success with your search engine value.

If you are beginning to see the merits of a blog and you've decided that it's time to start creating quality content, it's time to enter into the research phase of creating successful content for your page. If you're going to invest into content creation or even the time that it takes to write content, it's very important to do solid research into the types of content that your visitors are interested.

**Starting your research:**

Starting with research into your target market and the type of content that they are regularly viewing online is an excellent place to start. Begin by creating a LinkedIn group, checking in on twitter or even searching through online search engine trends. Starting to see some of the most trendy articles in your industry and some of the content that your viewers are seeking out first is important. By determining the type of content that you could create that will also attract a larger audience, you can start to plan out your content strategy for the future. With the use of search engine tools as well as social media networks the process of obtaining this research information has become much easier.

Keyword research is another excellent step in the right direction. Keywords are required to work at ranking your website in search engines. Using the Google keyword tool or completing keyword research with the help of a purchased report can help you to understand some of the main keywords that people are searching for when they want to find a site like yours. By having some of these keywords in mind you can intersperse these keywords are your content so that you can create content that's very valuable that also contains major keywords within your niche.

**Starting with keywords:**

Start with some relevant topics and keywords that are currently trending for all of your content. Trending content will always rank higher especially with news bulletins on search engine results.

Plan out keywords for blogs that you are going to be writing. Starting to create a keyword map for any future blog will help to make sure that you can create a natural piece of content that also has keywords that will rank for your page. With the help of a final list of keywords you can work at writing some content that can eventually be optimized for improvement before you post it.

Check your currently optimized keywords. Checking into Google analytics to see some of your websites traffic sources and understanding the organic keywords that are currently ranking your page will help you to focus on some different keywords or even strengthen the results that you get from keywords you're already ranking for. Checking Google analytics and focusing in on the keywords for new content that will help you rank higher in search engines or gain more followers based off of your current results can be a great step.

**Going a step further:**

When you start to run out of some of the main keywords that you have been targeting, it could be time to use the Google ad words keyword planner and some other tools to work out long tail keywords and rarer keywords that you could use to capture a larger audience. Focus on some of the largest keywords in your market first and then begin building off of the less popular content.

**Check your competition often:**

With any type of content it's important note the competition is doing. If Dave created a popular post or they have taken over a search engine ranking from you, you can consider looking into the types of keywords that they are optimizing for and the strategies that they are using to try and emulate them yourself or focus on changing your strategy to overtake them.
