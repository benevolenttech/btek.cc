The titles:

Most search engines don't show images next to the titles of the articles which are posted and as a result one of the first things that most users will look at is the title directly. In order to create a convincing title there a list of conditions for most search engines. It's important that a title show a specific attraction for the site, well-defined benefits for visiting the site and more in 60 words or less. Getting straight to the point and creating a effective title that also contains your keywords can be a very difficult focus technique. The trend in how lines is to talk about a particular benefit that a user can have just by reading over your article. Some example titles might be “Foods to help you lose weight” “Foods to help you gain more energy” although these are similar articles the benefits change and the focus of the article changes remarkably based off of just a few words. These are the types of headlines which are just leaving enough for a search engine to rank and to capture plenty of content in the process. Unfortunately for many website owners sometimes you have to get a little bit cheesy and write titles which act as “bait” for clicks in a search engine. Having a title that really shows people what they can account list by reading your article and making them want to click it will help to attract visitors even if your content isn't necessarily amazing.

Featured images:

Great blog posts need to have featured images and a strong image with your post can actually have an incredible impact on your search engine rating as well as the amount of people that will read on through your post. Visitors who are going to be stumbling through your blog or even scrolling through your blog will often stop if you have an impactful image that is also well optimized. Featured images will also be ranked in image search engine rankings and if you have something that is fairly original and optimized for particular keyword, this can also draw traffic into your content.

Having an image that is directly related to your content as well as images that really capture attention and match with your title is extremely important. Some of the main requirements that go along with any type of featured image for a blog can include:

How relevant is the image:&nbsp; choosing an image that simply isn't relevant for your page or your post is going to lead to confusion. Seek out graphics that summarize your post and fit the tone of your writing. Images that are in direct conflict with the type of content you are trying to produce can only create confusion.

Top-quality: A top-quality image that fits in with your design that can also be scaled while retaining the quality is an important touch. Keep in mind that any image will likely be compressed in order to be placed on your blog so that the content will load quickly. A high-quality image will capture attention without pixelation ensuring that you can keep your blog looking very professional.

Relevant images: the image that you choose should be extremely relevant and compelling. This means that the image you eventually pick out should be very appealing and eye-catching to the user.

Finding your featured image often requires a bit of brainstorming and research. Many blog owners also find themselves hiring photographers or even purchasing professional imagery off of stock image websites. Picking out a photo that is already well ranked or easy to find could potentially doom your post or have you run the chance that you get sued for stealing someone else's property.

Quality descriptions:

The description of your post is generally shown directly below the title in social media as well as in sharing. Writing in a great description is less critical than coming up with a great title but your description can often be the make or break text that a person needs to read in order to actually follow through with your link.

When you are writing descriptions and optimizing your descriptions keep these rules in mind:

Keep them accurate:&nbsp; misleading a search engine will actually penalize your posts because many individuals will go to your page and quickly leave which can be rank your page over time.

Explain benefits: adding benefits of reading your post in the description will show users more of the reasons why they should consider checking into your page. It can also be an excellent place that you can entice users with further benefits.

Add a call to action: call to action in your description actually increases the total number of people who will share your page as well as visit your page.

Consider your keyword research: please keywords near the front of your description as this can help to improve the ranking of your title and search engines. Work at creating a readable description that is extremely persuasive and legible.

Do something different: creating a description that's very similar to your competition and that doesn't differentiate itself remarkably from other posts you have done, will never get noticed.
