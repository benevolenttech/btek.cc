In this second of our SEO primer series, we cover the highest impact strategies to attract more people to your site.

1. **Make your site search engine friendly &lt;– you are here**
2. Plan your content
3. Write content worth sharing
4. Encourage sharing
5. Advertise on a budget

You may have a huge fanbase and massive traffic, but ignoring search engine and social network guidelines will sink your online visibility like an iceberg on a foggy night.

Here are the current guidelines to ensuring compatibility:

**Guideline 1 - Describe your pages with titles, descriptions and a picture**

Why? Search engines and social media require this information for search results and sharing. They get really cranky if you don't have these.

**Guideline 2 - Describe your website's structure with a sitemap file**

Search engines are imperfect at detecting inner pages of your website. Search engines crawl your page, like hikers on the side of a mountain. If you don’t give them a clear map, they won’t be able to find all the best parts of your site. You can help search engines by having your website platform maintain a sitemap file.

**Guideline 3 - Use basic network security with https**

You've probably noticed that your browser shows an indicator of whether a website is using secure networking next to the current URL. Well, search engines will dock you for not having it. Turns out that search engines kinda care about keeping their users safe (even Yahoo!), go figure? Not to mention that some users take online security very seriously.

**Guideline 4 - Be kind to all screen sizes**

Also called responsiveness, search engines will dock your search ranking if your website looks bad on smaller screens like phones. Not only is this important to increase your search ranking, but many visitors will be using a phone to view your website.

**Guideline 5 - Optimize your site's performance**

The amount of time it takes for your web page to load affects perception and satisfaction, so Google docks your search ranking if you load slowly. We’re working on a full tips and tricks article on performance – sign up for our email newsletter to get notified when it’s ready!

Most website platforms support these guidelines, but many of them don't out of the box. I recommend you google search each guideline coupled with the name of your website platform to research your options.

And…that's it! Now you know how to make your site perfect. Actually no you don’t, there are four more steps in this series, But at least it’s a good start.
