In this first of our SEO primer series, we will go through effective marketing tactics to convince users do what you want them to do -- like what you're selling and remember you when they're on the market.

People are impatient -- many will inevitably close your website in within seconds of opening.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you want more attention, then you need to prioritize ease of use and performance.

**Make it easy for visitors to find what they're looking for.**

After all, everyone has a goal in mind when they visit a website. Don’t assume people are going to hunt and peck around until they find what they want. IT SHOULD BE BLATANTLY OBVIOUS. If they can’t intuitively and quickly navigate your website, they drop out.

Assuming you already know the common reasons a person visits your site, focus on delivering instant gratification. Do so by drawing the visitors attention to what they seek and de-prioritize everything else. Why? Because in todays age, visitors scan your pages and drop out if you don't deliver satisfaction in that split-second.

On the note of designing around your visitors -- if you haven’t decided WHO you are marketing to -- you're chances are success are slim. Definitely start by interviewing your target visitors.

**Don’t Make Them Wait.**

Seems like a strange thing to worry about, right? But the speed of your site affects every metric you care about -- drop-out rate, search ranking, signups, page views, and even revenue (otherwise known as money in your bank account).

According to&nbsp;[surveys done by Akamai and Gomez.com](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/), nearly half of web users expect a site to load in 2 seconds or less, and they tend to abandon a site that isn’t loaded within 3 seconds. 79% of web shoppers who have trouble with web site performance say they won’t return to the site to buy again and around 44% of them would tell a friend if they had a poor experience shopping online.

This means you’re not just losing conversions from visitors currently on your site, but that loss is magnified to their friends and colleagues as well. The end result – lots of potential sales down the drain because of a few seconds difference.

And just about every major retailer online has come to the same conclusion: making your site faster can increase conversions.

Last summer Sherice Jacobs reported on a speed test run by Google. Then-Google VP Marissa Mayer asked users if they’d like 10 or 30 results per page. Hands down, web users wanted 30 results per page.

But when Google rolled out the changes and tested for speed (they are obsessed with speed) their jaws dropped. Traffic had dropped by 20% on those pages with 30 results.

The download speed difference? Half a second.

So how to get started?&nbsp;

1 - use page speed tools to examine what the highest priority improvements you can make are. &nbsp;I like WebpageTest.&nbsp; Google’s tool works, but I find it’s scoring system to be misguided.

2 - Ensure your images are sized to about the same size they are displayed on your website.

3 - Use image compression tools to reduce your image sizes without losing quality. My favorite is ImageOptim, which can be used online or downloaded as an app for Macs. I especially love how it compresses images in place.

4 - Utilize all caching and compression features available for your web framework. Wordpress does a really bad job with this out of the box, so do you homework.

5 - If hiring a developer, ensure they prioritize performance and are experts at all of the above.

There are some great methods that you can use to get started in optimizing your page as well as improving speed on your page.

A good place to start is with the webpage test as well as Google's tools. These scoring systems can help you to take a look at some primary items on your webpage that need to be addressed in order for you to enjoy a better search engine ranking. These tools are specifically designed for webmasters to use and you can get a report generated on some actionable items that could almost immediately improve your website.

Focusing on image sizes in using compression tools like imageoptim can be another fantastic way that you can speed the loading time on your page. There are also a series of WordPress extensions that can automatically compress every new image that you share on the site. This type of image compression can really help with the process of improving your website as well as the loading times for every page.

Consider working with a developer if you are interested in getting the best possible performance as well as a series of optimization options like a complete response of website conversion. If you have a website that is older without much content, it is possible that you can work in optimizing performance by working with a developer and outlining some of your goals for ranking and improvement.

By looking into improvements to make your site faster and more intelligently designed, it is possible that you can shoot up search engine rankings and create a much more effective website.
