Having a website is simply not an effective practice if no one has a tendency to stick around for very long. With a website that captures attention but doesnâ€™t keep visitors over long periods of time, you may find it difficult actually rank your page or even attract new users to your site. In this first part of our SEO instruction series we will look into some of the greatest impact strategies that you can use for making your site faster and more accessible to users.

**Part 1: Make your site faster and easier to use**

Part 4: How Can Content Be Optimized For Sharing and Search Engines

Part 5: &nbsp;How to Promote Your Website

In part one we will go through some of the elements of a website that actually make users stick around and keep your website users consistently coming back. Regular users as well as long-term users are some of the most important visitors for your website. Making the first step towards pleasing these visitors will help to make sure that you can create a page that will remain effective for your target market.

The first rule of some with designing any type of website interface is that you should never assume that your potential customers and visitors will hunt around to find the information that they are looking for. Search functions on your page are important but with an intuitive user interface is possible that a person could quickly navigate through your website and finding information on the pages that they are looking for.

**Designing your page around the goals of visitors:**

Guessing or hunting through website is wasted time and even if you're going for a user interface that is going to be an extremely minimalist design, the user interface should be extremely obvious. The way that people navigate your website should be an extremely obvious practice and by helping people to find the pages that they want to access, you can create some happy customers. Happy customers will in turn spend money and support your website for the future!

**Starting with the home page:**

Any great homepage is going to work like a piece of bait that gets a customer hooked. Make sure that you limit the messages available on your homepage and really focusing on content that is going to describe the type of website that you are offering. Create a strong brand on your homepage and make sure that you state the basic objectives and services that you are going to offer. If you'll give your visitors a type of guidance on the homepage, this can make it difficult for them to understand what your website is even about.

The instructions that you give your users should also be easily communicated. In most cases users will learn more about your website if you are able to tell powerful story about your brand or about the experiences that they can have by using your site. Creating a seamless flow across the website and a proper story that can give your customers a background is essential.

Think about some of the most impactful commercials you have ever watched on television, perhaps they were impactful because they told a story about that brand. Bringing in some humor or even creating a fun narrative about your brand that your users could read, can be far better than a boring old basic description of what your website can do.

**Identifying who you build the website for:**

If you haven't done some research into your target market it's going to be very difficult for you to actually rank your page. You need to have some very defined ideas about who your target market is from the beginning and who you are planning on building your website for. The journey to a successful website involves the use of creating successful materials that target a specific audience. Look into some research and establish some goals for your brand such as targeting teens that are interested in a particular sport. The more that you can zero in on your target market, the more refined your brand and your content can be for achieving high ranks for certain subject matters.

**Optimization:**

The speed of your site and the rate at which every element of your page loads will eventually affect your bottom line. Without some type of optimization on your page your search ranking, conversion rates, page views and more could all be potentially impacted. Reader satisfaction and revenue can also suffer as a result of a slow loading page.

In research completed by Gomez.com survey responders expected the average website to loading 2 seconds or less and if a page isn't loaded within 3 seconds users were much more likely to leave the website entirely. Nearly 80% of users in the survey suggested that they wouldn't go back to a website if they experience poor performance especially on an e-commerce platform.

Without proper optimization for your code and a website that functions on many different platforms, you could be missing out on a large portion of your target market as well as compromising your potential for a webpage.

**Responsive web design:**

A fast loading page also needs to be properly optimized for use on mobile devices. If you have a website theme that does not currently work on any type of mobile device like a tablet or a smart phone, this could potentially cause you lose out on half of your target market. Making sure that you have a responsive web design by working with google webtools or switching over to a theme that has a responsive design is extremely important. This is an optimization standard that is growing ever increasingly important especially with so many users trusting mobile devices for their primary web access tool.

**How do you get started with making your site easier to use and faster?**

There are some great methods that you can use to get started in optimizing your page as well as improving speed on your page.

A good place to start is with the webpage test as well as Google's tools. These scoring systems can help you to take a look at some primary items on your webpage that need to be addressed in order for you to enjoy a better search engine ranking. These tools are specifically designed for webmasters to use and you can get a report generated on some actionable items that could almost immediately improve your website.

Focusing on image sizes in using compression tools like imageoptim can be another fantastic way that you can speed the loading time on your page. There are also a series of WordPress extensions that can automatically compress every new image that you share on the site. This type of image compression can really help with the process of improving your website as well as the loading times for every page.

Consider working with a developer if you are interested in getting the best possible performance as well as a series of optimization options like a complete response of website conversion. If you have a website that is older without much content, it is possible that you can work in optimizing performance by working with a developer and outlining some of your goals for ranking and improvement.

By looking into improvements to make your site faster and more intelligently designed, it is possible that you can shoot up search engine rankings and create a much more effective website.
