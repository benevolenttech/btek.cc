In this first of our SEO primer series, we will go through effective marketing tactics to convince users do what you want them to do – like what you're selling and remember you when they're on the market.

1. **Make your site faster and easier to use &nbsp;&lt;– &nbsp;you are here**
2. How to Start Building Valuable Content for Your Website
3. How to Start Making Great Content
4. How Can Content Be Optimized For Sharing and Search Engines
5. How to Promote Your Website

People are impatient – many will inevitably close your website in within seconds of opening.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you want more attention, then you need to prioritize ease of use and performance.

**Make it easy for visitors to find what they're looking for.**

After all, everyone has a goal in mind when they visit a website. Don’t assume people are going to hunt and peck around until they find what they want. IT SHOULD BE BLATANTLY OBVIOUS. If they can’t intuitively and quickly navigate your website, they drop out.

Assuming you already know the common reasons a person visits your site, focus on delivering instant gratification. Do so by drawing the visitors attention to what they seek and de-prioritize everything else. Why? Because in todays age, visitors scan your pages and drop out if you don't deliver satisfaction in that split-second.

On the note of designing around your visitors – if you haven’t decided WHO you are marketing to – you're chances are success are slim. Definitely start by interviewing your target visitors.

**Don’t Make Them Wait.**

Seems like a strange thing to worry about, right? But the speed of your site affects every metric you care about – drop-out rate, search ranking, signups, page views, and even revenue (otherwise known as money in your bank account).

According to&nbsp;[surveys done by Akamai and Gomez.com](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/), nearly half of web users expect a site to load in 2 seconds or less, and they tend to abandon a site that isn’t loaded within 3 seconds. 79% of web shoppers who have trouble with web site performance say they won’t return to the site to buy again and around 44% of them would tell a friend if they had a poor experience shopping online.

This means you’re not just losing conversions from visitors currently on your site, but that loss is magnified to their friends and colleagues as well. The end result – lots of potential sales down the drain because of a few seconds difference.

And just about every major retailer has come to the same conclusion: making your site faster can increase conversions.

Here's the proof. Last summer Google [ran an experiment on page speed](http://blog.kissmetrics.com/speed-is-a-killer/). Google VP Marissa Mayer asked users if they’d like 10 or 30 results per page. Hands down, web users wanted 30 results per page.

But when Google rolled out the changes and tested for speed (they are obsessed with speed) their jaws dropped. Traffic had dropped by 20% on those pages with 30 results.

The download speed difference? Half a second.

Now you are probably thinking website performance is out of your power, but that's not true! The following are some essential strategies for improving website performance.

1 - Ensure your images are sized to about the same size they are displayed on your website. Some well-done website will help you with this, but there is no substitute for choosing an image based on where it's being displayed.

2 - Use image compression software to reduce your image sizes without losing quality. My favorite is [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/), which is crazy easy to use. It can be used online or downloaded as an app for Macs.

3 - Utilize all caching and compression features available for your web framework. Wordpress does a really bad job with this out of the box, so do your homework.

5 - If hiring a developer, ensure they prioritize performance and are experts at all of the above.

Already started work on your website? Use page speed tools to examine what the highest priority improvements you can make are. &nbsp;I like [WebpageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/easy.php).&nbsp; [Google’s tool](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) works, but I find it’s scoring system to be misguided.
