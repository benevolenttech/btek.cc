In this second of our SEO primer series, we cover the highest impact strategies to attract more people to your site.

1. **Make your site search engine friendly &lt;-- you are here**
2. Plan your content
3. Write content worth sharing
4. Encourage further engagement
5. Advertise on a budget

You may have a huge fanbase and massive traffic, but ignoring search engine and social network guidelines will sink your online visibility like an iceberg on a foggy night.

Here are the current guidelines to ensuring compatibility.

Guideline 1 - Describe your pages with titles, descriptions and a picture

Why? Search engines and social media require this information for search results and sharing. They get really cranky if you don't have these.

Guideline 2 - Describe your website's structure with a sitemap file

Search engines are imperfect at detecting inner pages of your website. You can help search engines by having your website platform maintain a sitemap file.

Guideline 3 - Use basic network security with https

You've probably noticed that your browser shows an indicator of whether a website is using secure networking next to the current URL. Well, search engines will dock you for not having it.

Guideline 4 - Be kind to all screen sizes

Also called responsiveness, search engines will dock your search ranking if your website looks bad on smaller screens like phones.

Guideline 5 - Optimize your site's performance

The amount of time it takes for your web page to load affects perception and satisfaction, so Google docks your search ranking if you load slowly.

And...that's it! Most website platforms support these guidelines, but many of them don't out of the box. I recommend you google search each guideline coupled with the name of your website platform to research your options.
