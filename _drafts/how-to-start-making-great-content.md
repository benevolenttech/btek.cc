Part 5: &nbsp;How to Promote Your Website

The overall goal of content on a blog or on a webpage is to have something that really **resonates with your audience**. If you don't know how to connect your audience or offer them something great with your content, it's possible that the content you are publishing is just filling up dead space on your website and offering almost 0 benefit to your users.

**Content creation is an art** and while there are many ways that you can outsource content with the help of freelance writers, guest posts and even hiring content creation specialists for your company, some of the best content is materials that come right from your employees. Learning how to produce quality content that your customers and viewers will like and that will also rank well on search engines is a skill that every website owner should learn. Here are some of the biggest elements that go into creating great content:

**Everything has a use but it’s also fun and easy to read:**

These three elements can be very difficult for the average website owner to balance. If you are able to consistently publish useful content that's easy to read and also fun for your viewers to access, this can really help with your search engine rankings. If people are stopping by your website it almost instantly leaving, there's simply no chance to convert them to the rest of your website or to even get them to view other content.

If someone finds an informative article that's been fun to read on your page and a link to a similar article that you published, there's a very good chance that they'll read it and an even better chance that they might continue on to sign up for your newsletter or even purchase one of your products.

Painful content that isn't well thought out and content that is simply designed to help you rank on search engines is not quality content. Stealing from other websites and publishing their content is also not quality content and you can be severely penalized for regularly plagiarizing content from other sites not to mention potentially sued.

Developing your own writer's voice and producing content that has personality and usefulness is truly one of the only ways to optimize for Google and other search engines. It's not necessarily about keywords, about the right formatting or even including original images, quality content takes time to really form.

***How to focus on each of the three main elements of quality content:***

**Creating something useful:**

The basis of content marketing is to create something that solves a particular problem for the reader or grants them some type of benefit. This is partially why there are so many different blogs which start with the words “How To” if the reader sees an immediate benefit to checking out the article and they are able to quickly solve a problem or get an answer, they will likely check into other blogs to see if they can learn even more. Creating a useful headline as well as content that is very easy to read will make sure that your readers can easily find the answers that they are seeking in your article. Of course there's no shame in leaving a little bit of mystery in the description and the title, this way the user may have to scroll through the first paragraph of your article to find their answers.

**It has to catch interest:**

Building a high-quality piece of content that has its own writer's voice and unique content throughout can make sure the person stays on page for an even longer amount of time. It can be extremely intimidating for a user to turn up to a website and see 3000 or even 5000 words worth of text. In order to make sure that they go through the content and really appreciate it, it has to be broken up and there has to be a charm to almost every paragraph.

Focusing in on the type of content you want to create such as conveying excitement, having a snarky writers voice or even expressing your political opinion in the article will make sure that it isn't quite as difficult to read. If someone supports your ideas or really enjoys the entertainment value of an article, they're much more likely to read every single word.

Finding a method for actually creating content and interesting way and creating the true brand voice for your website can sometimes take years. The best websites eventually has content that all sounds personal, looks somewhat similar and has the same feel. Branded content is a real phenomenon and it's something that's been going on for many years and some of the world's top publications such as GQ, the Wall Street Journal and even Buzzfeed style listicles. An ideal piece of content will create this branded style as well as serve a need of the client while speaking in this interesting writers voice. Eventually this writer's voice can become a very trusted and welcome presence in the lives of readers and they will check back for new content often.

**Focus on format:**

You don't necessarily have to be an English major to write great web content and writing modern web content often means making sacrifices that you may have learned with traditional writing.

The vast majority of web users are going to be scanning through content rather than reading every single line. If the user is presented with a large paragraph, they will often pick out some of the most important points. Creating content that reads more easily to an audience that scanning will help to make sure that people can find their answers quickly and easily digest your content.

Even when covering an extremely complex issue or demonstration of your product, creating structured paragraphs that move from point to point in a particular issue will help people to get the gist of what you are trying to say with some extra content included if they wanted to read further. Subheadings and bolded sections as well as Intergraph can also break up the content and make it more interesting and reader friendly.

Ultimately a blog format can take time to perfect but once you start to get a feel for design in your content posts, you can begin to understand what users are looking for while they are reading Web content.

**Great content is needed to build your audience:**

If you feel as though proper formatting and marketing could potentially save a bad post, this couldn't be further from the truth. Throwing money in marketing at poorly written content will often lead to a poor result. If you are going to be building a webpage in investing time in creating content, you need to be confident in the product you are making.

Don't be afraid to check into the competition and get examples of content that inspires you within your industry. Creating great content isn't easy and you definitely won't create a viral hit on every piece of blog content you create. Sticking with it and putting thought, research and personality into every post is one of the best ways that you can build your audience and add value to your website.
