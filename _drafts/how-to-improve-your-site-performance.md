People are impatient – many will inevitably close your website in within seconds of opening.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you want more attention, then you need to prioritize ease of use and performance.

&nbsp;

**Don’t Make Them Wait.**

Seems like a strange thing to worry about, right? But the speed of your site affects every metric you care about – drop-out rate, search ranking, signups, page views, and even revenue (otherwise known as money in your bank account).

According to&nbsp;[surveys done by Akamai and Gomez.com](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/), nearly half of web users expect a site to load in 2 seconds or less, and they tend to abandon a site that isn’t loaded within 3 seconds. 79% of web shoppers who have trouble with web site performance say they won’t return to the site to buy again and around 44% of them would tell a friend if they had a poor experience shopping online.

This means you’re not just losing conversions from visitors currently on your site, but that loss is magnified to their friends and colleagues as well. The end result – lots of potential sales down the drain because of a few seconds difference.

And just about every major retailer has come to the same conclusion: making your site faster can increase conversions.

Here's the proof. Last summer Google [ran an experiment on page speed](http://blog.kissmetrics.com/speed-is-a-killer/). Google VP Marissa Mayer asked users if they’d like 10 or 30 results per page. Hands down, web users wanted 30 results per page.

But when Google rolled out the changes and tested for speed (they are obsessed with speed) their jaws dropped. Traffic had dropped by 20% on those pages with 30 results.

The download speed difference? Half a second.

Now you are probably thinking website performance is out of your power, but that's not true! The following are some essential strategies for improving website performance.

1 - Ensure your images are sized to about the same size they are displayed on your website. Some well-done website will help you with this, but there is no substitute for choosing an image based on where it's being displayed.

2 - Use image compression software to reduce your image sizes without losing quality. My favorite is [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/), which is crazy easy to use. It can be used online or downloaded as an app for Macs.

3 - Utilize all caching and compression features available for your web framework. Wordpress does a really bad job with this out of the box, so do your homework.

5 - If hiring a developer, ensure they prioritize performance and are experts at all of the above.

Already started work on your website? Use page speed tools to examine what the highest priority improvements you can make are. &nbsp;I like [WebpageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/easy.php).&nbsp; [Google’s tool](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) works, but I find it’s scoring system to be misguided.
