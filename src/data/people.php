He's widely known for his marketing acumen coupled with a deep technical background, and a focus on community building.

A creative, engineer and leader whom loves all things web. He's like, obsessed with it (just ask his wife, Eileen). He's super lucky and thankful to get paid to do what he loves while helping small business and benevolent organizations.

He got his start in security software, then moved over to public sector where he was mentored by Confluence Corp and Ginkgo Street Labs. Later, he started btek and hasn't looked back since. Through his partners and btek, he's been able to help dozens of nonprofits with their online identities.

When I'm not doing web stuff, he hangs out with his toddler daughter or doing silly stuff with friends like competitive karaoke and bocce. Ask him some day how he won a free wedding.
