In this second of our SEO primer series, we cover the highest impact strategies to attract more people to your site.

1. Make your site search engine friendly
2. **Plan your content &lt;– you are here**
3. Write content worth **sharing**
4. Encourage sharing
5. Advertise on a budget

If you think you don’t need a blog, think again. Here are the top reasons to have a blog:

1) It helps drive traffic to your website.

2) It helps convert that traffic into leads.

3) It helps establish authority

There is very little chance of achieving high website traffic and SEO success without a blog. A nonprofit website without a blog amounts to little more than an online billboard, which might have been acceptable in days passed. Today, you need a blog in order to generate fresh content that readers want to share and search engines want to put in their results. A blog allows you to show off the expertise of your staff and the victories of your organization. If you can’t add a blog to your existing website, even an external blog on WordPress or Tumblr is better than no blog at all.

Now that you’ve agreed making a blog is a good idea, the first step is research.

Let’s face it — doing research might not be as fun as creating killer headlines, writing the first draft of a genius blog post, or crafting your next irresistible offer. But solid research is absolutely essential if you truly want to be successful in attracting visitors.

When you hear the word “research” in conjunction with content marketing, you might immediately think about keywords (and optimizing your content for search engines using those keywords.). And yes — keyword research is incredibly important. Mostly because it’s the language of your audience — even if search engines didn’t exist.

But to really dig into your research, you need to start thinking beyond just search engine optimization research. You need to think bigger.

Your audience is online right now, searching for things they want to discover more about, and looking for real-time answers to their questions. They’re also socializing online in LinkedIn groups, Google+ circles, and Twitter chats. So, it makes sense … your best research will come from the digging around and exploring in the places where your audience is socializing and searching.

This all sounds great on paper, right? You’re nodding and smiling and saying, “Of course!”

But research is the often-ignored, frequently avoided red-headed stepchild of content marketing.

So how can you do better (and more efficient) research, even if it’s not your favorite thing?

Answer: Keywords

So what are keywords? Keywords are a word or group of words which occurs in a text more often than we would expect to occur by chance alone. For example, if you wrote an article on fundraising using social networking, you’d probably have keywords like Facebook, Twitter, and Fundraising.&nbsp;

It may feel awkward to prioritize word-use while writing, but if you don’t use the words people are actually interested in and actively searching for, you’re missing a lot of traffic.

Getting Started with Keywords

Step 1: Make a list of important, relevant topics based on what you know about your business.

To kick off this process, think about the topics you want to rank for in terms of generic buckets. You'll come up with about 5-10 topic buckets you think are important to your business, and then you'll use those topic buckets to help come up with some specific keywords later in the process.

If you were a company like Benevolent Tech, for example – selling marketing services and software consulting – you might have general topic buckets like “SEO Companies in DC”, “Email Marketing in DC", “responsive website design" and "marketing automation."

Make sense?

Step 2: Fill in those topic buckets with keywords.

Now that you have a few topic buckets you want to focus on, it's time to identify some keywords that fall into those buckets. These are keyword phrases you think are important to rank for in the SERPs (search engine results pages) because your target customer is probably conducting searches for those specific terms.

For instance, if I took that last topic bucket for an inbound marketing software company – "marketing automation" – I'd brainstorm some keyword phrases that I think people would type in related to that topic. Those might include:

what is seo?

search engine optimizations tools

how can I make my business rise to the top of google?

how does Google rank the result of searches?

how to tell if I need search engine optimization?

what are keywords?

how to use Google Adwords Keyword Planner?

top seo tools

And so on and so on. The point of this step isn't to come up with your final list of keyword phrases – you just want to end up with a brain dump of phrases you think potential customers might use to search for content related to that particular topic bucket. We'll narrow the lists down later in the process so you don't have something too unwieldy.

Step 2: Find out which keywords your website is already getting found for

With services Google Analytics, you can learn what people were searching for when they found your site. &nbsp;Drill down in the Acquisitions-&gt;Keywords section of Google analytics to see website's traffic sources, and sift through you organic search traffic bucket to identify the keywords people are using to arrive at your site.

Repeat this exercise for as many topic buckets as you have.

Step 3: Generate more keywords with search terms.

This is a creative step you may have already thought of when doing keyword research. If not, it's a great way to fill out those lists.

If you're struggling to think of more keywords people might be searching about a specific topic, go to Google.com and take a look at the related search terms that appear when you plug in a keyword. When you type in your phrase and scroll to the bottom of Google's results, you'll notice some suggestions for searches related to your original input. These keywords can spark ideas for other keywords you may want to take into consideration.

Want a bonus? Type in some of those related search terms and look at THEIR related search terms.&nbsp;

Step 4: Scope out the competition

Just because your competitor is doing something doesn’t mean you need to. The same goes for keywords. Just because a keyword is important to your competitor, doesn’t mean it's important to you. However, understanding what keywords your competitors are trying to rank for is a great way to help you give your list of keywords another evaluation.

If your competitor is ranking for certain keywords that are on your list, too, it definitely makes sense to work on improving your ranking for those. However, don’t ignore the ones your competitors don’t seem to care about. This could be a great opportunity for you to own market share on important terms, too. &nbsp;Remember, the goal is to end up with a list of keywords that provide some quick wins but also helps you make progress toward bigger, more challenging SEO goals.

How do you figure out what keywords your competitors are ranking for, you ask? Aside from manually searching for keywords in an incognito browser and seeing what positions your competitors are in, SEMrush allows you to run a number of free reports that show you the top keywords for the domain you enter. This is a quick way to get a sense of the types of terms your competitors are ranking for.

Step 6: Use the Google AdWords Keyword Planner to cut down your keyword list.

Now that you've got the right mix of keywords, it's time to narrow down your lists with some more quantitative data. You have a lot of tools at your disposal to do this, but let me share my favorite methodology.

I like to use a mix of the Google AdWords Keyword Planner (you'll need to set up an AdWords account for this, but that doesn't mean you have to create an ad), and Google Trends.

Use the Keyword Planner to flag any terms on your list that have way too little (or way too much) search volume, and don't help you maintain a healthy mix like we talked about above. But before you delete anything, check out their trend history and projections in Google Trends. You can see whether, say, some low-volume terms might actually be something you should invest in now – and reap the benefits for later.

And … You're done!

Congratulations! You've now got a list of keywords that'll help you focus on the right topics for your business, and get you some short-term and long-term gains. You can even download our free SEO template to help you organize your keywords and track which terms you're focusing on for different pages of your website.

Be sure to re-evaluate these keywords every few months – once a quarter is a good benchmark, but some businesses like to do it even more often than that. As you gain even more authority in the SERPs, you'll find that you can add more and more keywords to your lists to tackle as you work on maintaining your current presence, and then growing in new areas on top of that. &nbsp;I also love using Wordle to metric my usage of keywords within content.
