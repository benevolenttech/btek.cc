Conversions are the heartbeat of any successful website — and if you’re looking to maximize them, no other web page can compete with the power of a carefully optimized landing page.

This is because landing pages are built with one goal and one goal only: To convert.

When you strip away the widgetized sidebar and navigation menu that compete for a visitor’s attention, you’re left with a page that’s dedicated to getting your message across — that your website is the best in its class, and that the visitor would be making a huge mistake to look elsewhere.

Landing pages can be used for many purposes — selling a product, driving an opt-in, or promoting an upcoming launch, to name but a few. In other words, they’re super relevant to almost all websites — whatever your goal.
